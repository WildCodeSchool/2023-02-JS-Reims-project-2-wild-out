## Concept

WildOut is a project realized within the framework of the Wild Code School Project 2. You don't know what to do today? What if you look at the events in your city taking into account the weather? That's where WildOut comes in. Thanks to our APIs and a bit of logic, we were able to set up a system so that WildOut shows you the right events based on the weather. 

## We Use: 
- For the project we used ReactJS , ExpressJS and Node for the functioning of the project. 
- The APIs used are OpenEvent,OpenWeather
- And for the map, we used ReactLeafLet and data from OpenStreetMap.

## How to use it? 
For the use of the project 
- Clone the project
- Get the nodes modules with 	```npm install	``` . 
- Start the server with 	```npm run dev	```
